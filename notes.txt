1 minute chess games, the loser gets an upgrade, and it's best of 3/5/7

Game data:
All the game data will have to be sent across clients to keep them synchronized
After each move send all of these to the server, then the server forwards it to the opponent and the opponent's client updates all of their
game variables with the ones from the server.
    - current game (int)
    - games won (int)
    - board state (2d array or string)
    - black/white (string)
    - time (float)
    - upgrades (list of Upgrades), this wouldn't have to be sent each time and would just exist client-side

Time management:
    Your timer pauses when you send data, and it resumes when you receive data.

Pages:
    - Home 
        Allows users to create room or join a room
        Create Room
        [TextField] Join button
    - Game 
        Shows board and a chat box on the side
        
Backend:
    type Room:
        id: string
        sockets: list[Socket]
        board: string // would be smaller if stored in FEN notation
        turn: string // string is more readable than a bool, and the slight size increase is negligible
        p1_wins: int
        p2_wins: int
        games_played: int
        best_of: int

    Store rooms in a dictionary like:
        {
            "id1": roomObject1,
            "id2": roomObject2,
            ...
        }

    Endpoints:
        - ws /rooms/{id}
            - used to join an existing room
            // check if room exists and make a socket
            if id in rooms:
                room = rooms[id]
                if len(room.sockets) < 2:
                    room.sockets.append(websocket)
                else:
                    websocket.send(ROOM_FULL_JSON)
                
                game_data = await websocket.receive_json()
                for socket in room.sockets:
                    await socket.send(game_data)

            else:
                websocket.send(ROOM_NOT_FOUND_JSON)

        - POST /rooms/create
            id = get_random_string(ID_SIZE)
            room = Room(id, [], DEFAULT_BOARD_STRING, "white", 0, 0, 0, data["best_of"])
            rooms.update({id: room})
            return {"status": 200, "id": id}
            After creating the room the client will automatically go to /rooms/{id} with the returned id.
